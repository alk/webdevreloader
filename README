Smart web application reloader
------------------------------

This is simple http request forwarder that checks your application
sources for changes and transparently restarts it if there are any.

It works with any web technology and provides development convenience
similar (but superior) to Rails development mode reloading.

Make your source change and than simply hit reload button. Reloader
will notice change and will transparently restart your application.

Usage
-----

Upstream port (the one you should point your broswer to) is controlled
by -u option. Downstream port where your application server listens is
controlled by -d option. You can pass file patterns to check for
changes by -w options. Rest of command line arguments are interpreted
as a command to run your application.

All options has defaults suitable for Rails applications. In this case
just use command 'reloader ./script/server'.

Other cases need suitable options. For example I use the following
command line to run ns_server which is erlang application:

reloader -T 30 -s TERM -u 3000 -d 8080 -w '**/*.erl' -w '**/*.js' -- sh -c 'make -j3 fast-rebuild && ./start_shell.sh -noshell'

This command forwards port 3000 to port 8080 (erlang server binds to
8080). It also checks mtimes of all erlang (*.erl) and javascript
(*.js) sources.

As you can see you can easily invoke make to (re)build
application. Also note that your application is run as background
process group, so it should not try to read stdin. I pass -noshell to
erlang to avoid that.
